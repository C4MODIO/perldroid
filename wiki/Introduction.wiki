= Introduction =

The « perldroid » project aims to port the language Perl on Android, and especially for the HTC-Dream alias T-Mobile G1.

= Details =

The « PerlDroid » application will be able to download and install Perl script packages, along with Perl modules (core modules at minima) and to execute them.

Details on how this will be done are not yet completely defined. This page will be updated and other pages will be created as the project matures.

= Infos =

For the moment I've put my experiments on the pages http://gtmp.org/publications:perl-on-android and http://gtmp.org/publications:perl-on-android-2 . Take a look at them if you are interested.
