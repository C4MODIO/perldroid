#summary Memo that allow to finger member's current work (please feed)

= Introduction =

This .plan lists the things members are working on.


= Details =

== Ben ==
  * make a shared sandbox: see the `sandbox` svn branch.
  * find the _oldest_ android revision that compile flawlessly. *Update:* Given the few available branches on http://android.git.kernel.org/ the _oldest_ android that compile is more recent than the android which is on the HTC G1, so it is impossible to build a bionic libc that, in terms of C API, matches exactly the one on the HTC phone. :-(
  * make a Cross/ that allow perl-5.10.0 to compile on that old android revision. *Update:* currently, libperl.so only compiles on a too recent bionic libc. nasty things must be done to allow then to use it on the phone. :-(

== Mid ==
  * Proofs of concepts / tests on real G1 phone
  * Java code to download and install core-modules in /sdcard *Update:* NOT POSSIBLE to mmap from /sdcard :-(
  * Core modules will be optional. Make a perl program to package them
